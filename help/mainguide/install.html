To install PureBasic, just click on the install wizard, follow the steps, and then 
click on the PureBasic icon (found on the desktop or in the start-menu) to launch PureBasic. 
<br>
<br>
To use the command line compiler, open a standard command line window (CMD) and look in the "Compilers\" subdirectory for PBCompiler.exe. It's a good idea to consider adding 
the "PureBasic\Compilers\" directory to the PATH environment variable to make the compiler accessible from any directory. 
<br>
<br>
Important note: to avoid conflicts with existing PureBasic installations (maybe even with user-libraries), 
please install a new PureBasic version always in its own new folder. See also the chapter <a href="../reference/several_pb.html">Using several PureBasic versions</a>.
