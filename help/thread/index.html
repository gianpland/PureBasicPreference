<p><b>Overview</b></p><blockquote>


A thread is a part of a program which runs asynchronously, in the background 
of this program. This means it's possible to perform long operations 
(compression, image processing, etc) without halting the whole program and let the user 
continue to do other things. A thread runs within your program, it's not 
another process. When the main program exits, all the threads are destroyed. 
Under PureBasic, threads are simply a procedure which is called asynchronously. 
The thread runs until the procedure exits. 
<br>
<br>
Examples of places of programs where threads are useful are when you need to be able to handle 
multiple situations with different response times or which occur at different 
intervals. In the above paragraph, the response times of image processing and the 
user interface are quite different (you would want to wait for the image to be processed 
but always have the user interface to respond). 
<br>
<br>
PureBasic has a special compiler setting to create thread-safe executables. (/THREAD command-line 
switch or "create thread-safe executable" in the IDE compiler options). Without this mode, 
certain functions (and also the string access) are faster, but not save to use in threads. 
It is still possible to create threads without this mode but it is not recommended, as even something simple 
like a local string access can be dangerous and needs to be protected. 
Enabling this option makes these things save inside threads, but comes at the price of 
some speed. The decision on whether or not to use threads should therefore done with care, 
and the threadmode should only be used when there is a real need for it. 
<br>
<br>
Note: Threads need to be used carefully because it is possible that you can have 
multiple access to shared resources (memory, variables, files, etc) and you need 
to manually ensure that you do run into trouble because of this. The Mutex functions in 
this library can be used to synchronize access to such shared resources. 
<br>
<br>
Using the <a href="../reference/threaded.html">Threaded</a> keyword it's possible to create thread-based 
persistent objects (variables, arrays, lists, maps). 

<br>
<br>
Note: Don't use DirectX inside threads (MS Windows limitation)! If you need to display 
graphics in threads use <a href="../image/index.html">Images</a> and 
<a href="../2ddrawing/index.html">2DDrawing</a> instead.
