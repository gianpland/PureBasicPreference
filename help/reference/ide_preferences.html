The PureBasic IDE provides many options to customize or disable some of its 
features in order to become the perfect tool for you. 
<br>
<br>
These options are accessible from the Preferences command in the File menu, and the 
meaning of each setting is described here. 

<br>
<br>

Any changes made will only take effect once you click the "OK" button or "Apply". 

<p><b>General</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_general.png"></p>

Options that affect the general behavior of the IDE. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Run only one Instance</b> 
<br>
If set, prevents the IDE from being opened more than once. Clicking on a 
PB file in the explorer will open it in the already existing IDE instance 
instead of opening a new one. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Disable Splash screen</b> 
<br>
Disables the splash screen that is displayed on start-up. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Memorize Window positions</b> 
<br>
Remembers the position of all IDE windows when you close them. If you prefer to 
have all windows open at a specific location and size, enable this option, move 
all windows to the perfect position, then restart the IDE (to save all options) 
and then disable this option to always open all windows in the last saved position. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Show window contents while moving the Splitter</b> 
<br>
Enable this only if you have a fast computer. Otherwise moving the Splitter 
bar to the Error Log or Tools Panel may flicker a lot. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Auto-Reload last open sources</b> 
<br>
On IDE start-up, opens all the sources that were open when the IDE was closed the last time. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display full Source Path in Title bar</b> 
<br>
If set, the IDE title bar will show the full path to the currently 
edited file. If not, only the filename is shown. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Recent Files list</b> 
<br>
This setting specifies how many entries are shown in the "Recent Files" 
submenu of the File menu. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Search History size</b> 
<br>
This setting specifies how many recent search words are 
remembered for "Find/Replace" and "Find in Files" 

<br>
<br>

<b>Check for updates</b> 
<br>
Specifies how often the IDE should check on the purebasic.com server for the 
availability of new updates. An update check can also be performed manually at any time 
from the "Help" menu. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Check for releases</b> 
<br>
Specifies which kind of releases should cause a notification if they are available. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>General - Language</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_language.png"></p>

This allows you to change the language of the IDE. The combo box shows the 
available languages, and you can view some information about the language file 
(for example who translated it and when it was last updated). 




</blockquote>
<p><b>General - Shortcuts</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_shortcuts.png"></p>

Here you can fully customize all the shortcut commands of the IDE. Select an entry from 
the list, select the shortcut field, enter the new key combination and 
click "Set" to change the entry. 

<br>
<br>

Note that Tab & Shift+Tab are reserved for block-indentation and un-indentation and 
cannot be changed. Furthermore some key combination might have a special meaning for 
the OS and should therefore not be used. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>General - Themes</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_themes.png"></p>

This section shows the available icon themes for the IDE and allows to select 
the theme to use. The IDE comes with two themes by default. 
<br>
<br>
More themes can be easily added by creating a zip-file containing the images 
(in png format) and a "Theme.prefs" file to describe the theme. The zip-file 
has to be copied to the "Themes" folder in the PureBasic installation directory 
to be recognized by the IDE. The "SilkTheme.zip" file can be used as an example 
to create a new theme. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display Icons in the Menu</b> 
<br>
Allows to hide/show the images in the IDE menus. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Show main Toolbar</b> 
<br>
Allows to hide/show the main toolbar in order to gain space for the editing area. 



</blockquote>
<p><b>General - Toolbar</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_toolbar.png"></p>

This allows to fully customize the main Toolbar. By selecting an entry and 
using the Buttons in the "Position" section, you can change the order. The 
"Item Settings" section can be used to modify the entry or add a new one. 
New ones are always added at the end of the list. 

<br>
<br>

Types of items: 
<br>
<b>Separator</b> : a vertical separator line. 
<br>
<b>Space</b> : an empty space, the size of one toolbar icon. 
<br>
<b>Standard Icon</b> : allows you to select a OS standard icon from the combo box on the right. 
<br>
<b>IDE Icon</b> : allows you to select one of the IDE's own icons in the combo box on the right. 
<br>
<b>Icon File</b> : allows you to specify your own icon file to use in the edit box on the right 
(PNG files are supported on all platforms, Windows additionally supports icon files). 

<br>
<br>
If you do not select a separator or space, you can specify an action to carry out when the button is pressed: 
<br>

<b>Menu Item</b> : carries out the menu command specified in the combo box on the right. 
<br>
<b>Run tool</b> : executes the external tool specified in the combo box on the right. 

<br>
<br>

The "Default Sets" section contains two standard toolbar 
sets which you can select, and later modify. 



</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_editor.png"></p>

Settings that affect the management of the source codes. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Monitor open files for changes on disk</b> 
<br>
Monitors all open files for changes that are made to the files on disk while they are edited in the IDE. 
If modifications are made by other programs, a warning is displayed with the choice to reload the file from disk. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Auto-save before compiling</b> 
<br>
Saves the current source code before each compile/run or executable creation. Note that 
any open <a href="../reference/includes.html">include files</a> are not automatically saved. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Save all sources with Auto-save</b> 
<br>
Saves all sources instead of just the current one with one of the Auto-save options. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Memorize cursor position</b> 
<br>
Saves the current cursor position, as well as the state of 
all folding marks with the compiler options for the source file. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Memorize Marker positions</b> 
<br>
Saves all the Markers with the options for the source file. 


<br>
<br>

<b>Always hide the error log</b> 
<br>
The error log can be shown/hidden on a per-source basis. This option provides a global 
setting to ignore the per-source setting and never display the error log. It also removes 
the corresponding menu entries from the IDE menu. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Save settings to</b> 
<br>
This option allows to specify where the compiler options of a 
source file are saved: 

<br>
<br>

<blockquote>


<u>The end of the Source file</u> 
<br>
Saves the settings as a special comment block at the end of each source file. 

<br>
<br>

<u>The file &#060;filename&#062;.pb.cfg</u> 
<br>
Creates a .pb.cfg file for each saved source code that contains this information. 

<br>
<br>

<u>A common file project.cfg for every directory</u> 
<br>
Creates a file called project.cfg in each directory where PB files are 
saved. This one file will contain the options for all files in that directory. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Don't save anything</u> 
<br>
No options are saved. When reopening a source file, the 
defaults will always be used. 

</blockquote>


<br>
<br>


<b>Tab Length</b> 
<br>
Allows to specify how many spaces are inserted each time you press the Tab key. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Use real Tab (Ascii 9)</b> 
<br>
If set, the tab key inserts a real tab character instead of spaces. 
If not set, there are spaces inserted when Tab is pressed. 
<br>
<br>
Note that if real tab is used, the "Tab Length" option specifies 
the size of one displayed tab character. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Source Directory</b> 
<br>
Specifies the default directory used in the Open and Save dialogs 
if no other files are currently open (if another file is open, its 
path will be used as default). 
<br>
<br>
Set this to the path were you usually save the source codes. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Code file extensions</b> 
<br>
The IDE detects code files by their extension (pb, pbi or pbf by default). Non-code files 
are edited in a "plain text" mode in which code-related features are disabled. 
This setting causes the IDE to recognize further file extensions as code files. 
The field can contain a comma-separated list (i.e. "pbx, xyz") of extensions to recognize. 

<br>
<br>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Editing</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_editorfont.png"></p>

Use "Select Font" to change the font used to display the source code. 
To ensure a good view of the source code, it should be a fixed-size font, 
and possibly even one where bold characters have the same size as non-bold ones. 

<br>
<br>



<b>Enable bolding of keywords</b> 
<br>
If your font does not display bold characters in the same size 
as non-bold ones, you should disable this option. If disabled, 
the keywords will not be shown as bold. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Enable case correction</b> 
<br>
If enabled, the case of PureBasic keywords, PureBasic Functions 
as well as predefined constants will automatically be corrected 
while you type. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Enable marking of matching Braces</b> 
<br>
If enabled, the brace matching the one under the cursor will be highlighted. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Enable marking of matching Keywords</b> 
<br>
If enabled, the keyword(s) matching the one under the cursor will be underlined. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display line numbers</b> 
<br>
Shows or hides the line number column on the left. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Coloring</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_editorcolors.png"></p>

Here you can change the color settings for the syntax coloring, as well as 
the debugger marks. Default color schemes can be selected from the box on the 
bottom, and also modified after they have been set. 
Individual color settings can be disabled by use of the checkboxes. 


<br>
<br>

Note: The 'Accessibility' color scheme has (apart from high-contrast colors) a special setting 
to always use the system color for the selection in the code editor. This helps screen-reader 
applications to better detect the selected text. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Coloring - Custom Keywords</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_ownkeywords.png"></p>

In this section, a list of custom keywords can be defined. These keywords can have a special color 
assigned to them in the coloring options and the IDE will apply case-correction to them if this feature is enabled. 
This allows for applying a special color to special keywords by preprocessor tools or macro sets, 
or to simply have some PB keywords colored differently. 

<br>
<br>

Note that these keywords take precedence above all other coloring in the IDE, so this allows to 
change the color or case correction even for PureBasic keywords. 

<br>
<br>

The keywords can be either entered directly in the preferences or specified in a text file with 
one keyword per line (or both). 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Folding</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_editorfolding.png"></p>

Here you can set the keywords in the source code that start/end a foldable 
section of code. You can add any number of words that will mark such a sections. 
You can also choose to completely disable the folding feature. 
<br>
<br>
Words that are found inside comments are ignored, unless the defined keyword includes 
the comment symbol at the start (like the default ";{" keyword). 
<br>
<br>
A keyword may not include spaces. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Indentation</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_indent.png"></p>

Here you can specify how the editor handles code indentation when the return key is pressed. 
<br>
<br>


<b>No indentation</b> 
<br>
Pressing return always places the cursor at the beginning of the next line. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Block mode</b> 
<br>
The newly created line gets the same indentation as the one before it. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keyword sensitive</b> 
<br>
Pressing the return key corrects the indentation of both the old line and the new line depending 
on the <a href="../reference/general_rules.html">keywords</a> on these lines. The rules for this are specified in the keyword list below. These 
rules also apply when the "Reformat indentation" item in the <a href="../reference/ide_editing.html">edit menu</a> is used. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Show indentation guides</b> 
<br>
Causes vertical lines to be shown to visualize the indentation on each line. This makes it easier 
to see which source lines are on the same level of indentation. 

<br>
<br>


<b>Show whitespace characters</b> 
<br>
Causes whitespace characters to be visible as little dots (spaces) or arrows (tab characters). 

<br>
<br>

The keyword list contains the keywords that have an effect on the indentation. The "Before" setting specifies 
the change in indentation on the line that contains the keyword itself while the "After" setting specifies the 
change that applies to the line after it. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Auto complete</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_autocomplete.png"></p>


<b>Display the full Auto complete list</b> 
<br>
Always displays all keywords in the list, but selects the closest match. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display all words that start with the first character</b> 
<br>
Displays only those words that start with the same character as you typed. 
The closest mach is selected. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display only words that start with the typed word</b> 
<br>
Does not display any words that do not start with what you typed. 
If no words match, the list is not displayed at all. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Box width / Box height</b> 
<br>
Here you can define the size of the auto complete list (in pixel). 
Note that these are maximum values. The displayed box may become smaller if there are only a few items to display. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add opening Brackets to Functions/Arrays/Lists</b> 
<br>
Will automatically add a "(" after any function/Array/List inserted by auto 
complete. Functions with no parameters or lists get a "()" added. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add a Space after PB Keywords followed by an expression</b> 
<br>
When inserting PB keywords that cannot appear alone, a space 
is automatically added after them. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add matching ‘End' keyword if Tab/Enter is pressed twice</b> 
<br>
If you press Tab or Enter twice, it will insert the corresponding end 
keyword (for example "EndSelect" to "Select" or "EndIf " to "If") to 
the keyword you have just inserted. The end keyword will be inserted 
after the cursor, so you can continue typing after the first keyword 
that was inserted. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Automatically popup AutoComplete for Structure items</b> 
<br>
Displays the list automatically whenever a structured variable or interface is entered 
and the "\" character is typed after it to show the list of possible structure 
fields. If disabled, the list can still be displayed by pressing the keyboard 
shortcut to open the AutoComplete window (usually Ctrl+Space, this can be modified 
in the Shortcuts section of the Preferences). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Automatically popup AutoComplete outside of Structures</b> 
<br>
Displays the list automatically when the current word is not a structure after 
a certain amount of characters has been typed, and a possible match in the list 
is found. If disabled, the list can still be displayed by pressing the assigned 
keyboard shortcut. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Characters needed before opening the list</b> 
<br>
Here you can specify how many characters the word must have minimum 
before the list is automatically displayed. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Auto complete - Displayed items</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_autocompletelist.png"></p>

This shows a list of possible items that can be included with the possible matches in the AutoComplete list. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Source code Items</b> 
<br>
Items defined in the active source code, or other open sources (see below). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Predefined Items</b> 
<br>
Items that are predefined by PureBasic, such as the PureBasic keywords, functions or predefined constants. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add Items from: the current source only</b> 
<br>
Source code items are only added from the active source code. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add Items from: the current project (if any)</b> 
<br>
Source code items are added from the current project if there is one. The other source codes in the 
project do not have to be currently open in the IDE for this. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add Items from: the current project or all files (if none)</b> 
<br>
Source code items are added from the current project. If the current source code does not 
belong to the open project then the items from all open source codes will be added. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Add Items from: all open files</b> 
<br>
Source code items are added from all currently open source codes. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Issues</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_issues.png"></p>

Allows to configure the collection of 'issue' markers from comments in the source code. 
Issue markers can be displayed in the <a href="../reference/ide_tools.html">Issues</a> or ProcedureBrowser 
tool, and they can be marked within the source code with a separate background color. 

<br>
<br>

A definition for an issue consists of the following: 

<blockquote>


<u>Issue name</u> 
<br>
A name for the type of issue. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Regular expression</u> 
<br>
A regular expression defining the pattern for the issue. This regular expression 
is applied to all comments in the source code. Each match of the expression is 
considered to match the issue type. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Priority</u> 
<br>
Each issue type is assigned a priority. The priority can be used to order and filter 
the displayed issues in the issue tool. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Color</u> 
<br>
The color used to mark the issue in the source code (if enabled). The color will be used 
to mark the background of either only the issue text itself, or the entire code line depending 
on the coloring option. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Show in issue tool</u> 
<br>
If enabled, any found issues of this type are listed in the issues tool. This option 
can be disabled to cause an issue to only be marked in the source code with a special 
background color if desired. 

<br>
<br>

<u>Show in procedure browser</u> 
<br>
If enabled, any found issues are shown as an entry in the procedure browser tool. 

</blockquote>


</blockquote>
<p><b>Editor - Session history</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_sessionhistory.png"></p>

Allows to configure how the session history is recording changes. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Enable recording of history</b> 
<br>
Enable or disable the history session recording. When enabled, all the changes made to a file will be recorded 
in the background in a database. A session is created when the IDE launch, and is closed when the IDE quits. 
This is useful to rollback to a previous version of a file, or to find back a deleted 
or corrupted file. It's like a very powerful source backup tool, limited in time (by default one month 
of recording). It's not aimed to replace a real source versioning system like SVN or GIT. It's complementary 
to have finer change trace. The source code will be stored without encryption, so if you are working on 
sensitive source code, be sure to have this database file in a secure location, or disable this feature. 
It's possible to define the session history database location using an <a href="../reference/ide_commandline.html">IDE command-line</a> switch. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Record change every X minutes</b> 
<br>
Change the interval between each silent recording (when editing). A file will be automatically recorded when 
saving or closing it. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Record only changes to files smaller than X kilobytes</b> 
<br>
Change the maximum size (in kilobytes) of the files being recorded. This allow to exclude very big files which 
could make the database grow a lot. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keep all history</b> 
<br>
Keep all the history, the database is never purged. It will always grows, so it should be watched. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keep maximum X sessions</b> 
<br>
After reaching the maximum number of sessions, the oldest session will be removed from the database. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keep sessions for X days</b> 
<br>
After reaching the maximum number of days, the session will be removed from the database. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Compiler</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_compiler.png"></p>

This page allows to select additional compilers which should be available for compilation 
in the <a href="../reference/ide_compiler.html">Compiler Options</a>. This allows switching between different 
compilers of the same version (like the x86 and x64 compilers) or even switching between different 
versions easily. 
<br>
<br>
Any PureBasic compiler starting from Version 4.10 can be added here. The target processor of the 
selected compilers does not have to match that of the default compiler, as long as the target 
operating system is the same. The list displays the compiler version and path of the selected 
compilers. 
<br>
<br>
The information used by the IDE (for code highlighting, auto complete, structure viewer) always 
comes from the default compiler. The additional compilers are only used for compilation. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Compiler - Defaults</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_editorstandards.png"></p>

This page allows setting the default compiler options that will be 
used when you create a new source code with the IDE. 
<br>
<br>
For an explanation of the meaning of each field, see the <a href="../reference/ide_compiler.html">Compiler Options</a>. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Debugger</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_debugger.png"></p>

Settings for the internal Debugger, or the Standalone Debugger. 
The command-line debugger is configured from the command-line only. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Debugger Type</b> 
<br>
Select the type of debugger you want to use when compiling from the IDE here. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Choose Warning level</b> 
<br>
Select the action that should be taken if the debugger issues a warning. 
The available options are: 
<br>
<u>Ignore Warnings:</u> Warnings will be ignored without displaying anything. 
<br>
<u>Display Warnings:</u> Warnings will be displayed in the error log and the source 
code line will be marked, but the program continues to run. 
<br>
<u>Treat Warnings as Errors:</u> A warning will be treated like an error. 
<br>
See <a href="../reference/ide_debugger.html">Using the debugger</a> for more information on debugger warnings and errors. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Memorize debugger window positions</b> 
<br>
The same as the "Memorize Window positions" for in the General 
section, but for all Debugger windows. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keep all debugger windows on top</b> 
<br>
All debugger windows will be kept on top of all other windows, 
even from other applications. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Bring Debugger windows to front when one is focused</b> 
<br>
With this option set, focusing one window that belongs to the 
debugger of a file, all windows that belong to the same debugging 
session will be brought to the top. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Display Timestamp in error log</b> 
<br>
Includes the time of the event in the error log. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Stop execution at program start</b> 
<br>
Each program will be started in an already halted mode, giving 
you the opportunity to start moving step-by-step, right from 
the start of the program. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Stop execution before program end</b> 
<br>
Stops the program execution right before the executable would 
unload. This gives you a last chance to use the debugging tools 
to examine Variables or Memory before the program ends. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Kill Program after an Error</b> 
<br>
If a program encounters an error, it will be directly ended and all 
debugger windows closed. This gives the opportunity to directly modify 
the code again without an explicit "Kill Program", but there is no chance 
to examine the program after an error. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Keep Error marks after program end</b> 
<br>
Does not remove the lines marked with errors when the program ends. This gives 
the opportunity to still see where an error occurred while editing the code again. 
<br>
<br>
The marks can be manually removed with the "Clear error marks" command in the "Error log" 
submenu of the debugger menu. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Clear error log on each run</b> 
<br>
Clears the log window when you execute a program. This ensures that the log does not 
grow too big (this option is also available with the command-line debugger selected). 

<br>
<br>

<b>Timeout for Debugger startup</b> 
<br>
Specifies the time in milliseconds how long the debugger will wait for a program to 
start up before giving up. This timeout prevents the debugger from locking up 
indefinitely if the executable cannot start for some reason. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Debugger - Individual Settings</b></p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Tools Panel</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_toolspanel.png"></p>

This allows configuring the internal tools that can be displayed in the side panel. 
Each tool that is in the "Displayed Tools" list is displayed in the Panel on the 
side of the edit area. Each tool that is not listed there is accessible from the 
Tools menu as a separate window. 
<br>
Put only those tools in the side panel that you use very frequently, and put the 
most frequently used first, as it will be the active one once you open the IDE. 

<br>
<br>

By selecting a tool in either of the lists, you get more configuration options 
for that tool (if there are any) in the "Configuration" section below. 

<br>
<br>
Here is an explanation of those tools that have special options: 

<br>
<br>

<b>Explorer</b> 
<br>
You can select between a Tree or List display of the file-system. 
You can also set whether the last displayed directory should be remembered, 
or if the Source Path should be the default directory when the IDE is started. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Procedure Browser</b> 
<br>
"Sort Procedures by Name" : sorts the list alphabetically (by default they are listed as they appear in the code). 
<br>
"Group Markers" : groups the ";-" markers together. 
<br>
"Display Procedure Arguments" : Displays the full declaration of each procedure in the list. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Variable Viewer</b> 
<br>
The "Display Elements from all open sources" option determines whether 
the list should only include items from this code, or from all open codes. 
<br>
<br>
Furthermore you can select the type of items displayed in the Variable viewer. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Help Tool</b> 
<br>
"Open sidebar help on F1": specifies whether to open the help tool instead of the separate help viewer when F1 is pressed. 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Tools panel - Options</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_toolspanel_options.png"></p>

Here you can customize the appearance of the Tools Panel a bit more. You can 
select the side on which it will be displayed, a Font for its text, as well 
as a foreground and background color for the displayed tools. 
The font and color options can be disabled to use the OS defaults instead. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Do not use colors/fonts for tools in external windows</b> 
<br>
If set, the color/font options only apply to the Tools displayed in the Panel, 
those that you open from the Tools menu will have the default colors. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Automatically hide the Panel</b> 
<br>
To save space, the Panel will be hidden if the mouse is not over it. 
Moving the mouse to the side of the IDE will show it again. 

<br>
<br>

<b>Milliseconds delay before hiding the Panel</b> 
<br>
Sets a timeout in ms, after which the Panel is hidden if you leave it with the mouse. 


</blockquote>
<p><b>Import/Export</b></p><blockquote>


<p><img src="images/ide_prefs_import.png"></p>

This section allows you to export the layout settings of the IDE in a platform independent 
format, which allows you to import them again into the PureBasic IDE on another Operating System, 
or to share your options with other PB users. 

<br>
<br>

To export your settings, select what types of settings you want to include, select a 
filename and press the "Save" button. 

<br>
<br>

To import settings, select the filename and press "Open". You will then see the options that are 
included in this file as enabled checkboxes. After selecting what you want to import, click the 
"Import Settings" button. 

<br>
<br>

For the new settings to take effect, you have to first click the apply button. 

<br>
<br>

Note: You can import the style files from the jaPBe Editor, but only the color settings will be imported.
