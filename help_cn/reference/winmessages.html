<p><b>Introduction</b></p><blockquote>





The messages for your program will be sent by Windows into a queue, which is worked 
off only if you want this. Windows sends thousand messages to your program without 
noticing this directly. <br>
<br>
For example if you change the status of a gadget (identical whether you add a new entry 
or change the image of an ImageGadget), a message is sent to the queue of your program. <br>
<br>
There are two possibilities to receive and to process the Windows messages in PureBasic: 
<a href="../window/waitwindowevent.html">WaitWindowEvent()</a> and <a href="../window/windowevent.html">WindowEvent()</a>. 
The difference is, that WaitWindowEvent() waits till 
a message arrives and WindowEvent() continues to work also so. The messages in the queue 
will be processed however only, after you have called WindowEvent() or WaitWindowEvent(). 

 

</blockquote>
<p><b>Specials of WindowEvent()</b></p><blockquote>





The command WindowEvent() don&amp;apos;t wait, until a message arrives, but checks only whether one is in the queue. 
If yes, the message is processed and WindowEvent() gives back the number of the message. If no message 
lines up, then zero (0) is given back. 

 

<p><b>示例</b></p><blockquote>


<pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size="2">  <b><font color="#006666">While</font></b> <font color="#006666">WindowEvent</font>() : <b><font color="#006666">Wend</font></b>
</font></pre>



cause, that WindowEvent() becomes called as long till it gives back 0, i.e. until all 
messages of the queue are processed. <br>
<br>
It doesn&amp;apos;t reach, if you insert a simple &amp;apos;WindowEvent()&amp;apos; after a <a href="../gadget/setgadgetstate.html">SetGadgetState()</a> to process 
this 1 message. Firstly there still can be other messages in the queue, which have arrived 
before, and secondly Windows also sends quite a number of other messages, we don&amp;apos;t have to 
take care of... which nevertheless are in the queue. <br>
<br>
A simple call of 
 
<pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size="2"><font color="#006666">  WindowEvent</font>()
</font></pre>

doesn&amp;apos;t reach, the code then runs correct under circumstances on one Windows version, but on 
another version not. The different Windows versions are internally very different, so that 
one version only sends 1 message but another Windows version sends 5 messages for the same circumstance. <br>
<br>
Because of this one always uses for updating: 
 
<pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size="2">  <b><font color="#006666">While</font></b> <font color="#006666">WindowEvent</font>() : <b><font color="#006666">Wend</font></b>
</font></pre>

Of course there is also the alternative 
 
<pre><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"size="2">  <b><font color="#006666">Repeat</font></b> : <b><font color="#006666">Until</font></b> <font color="#006666">WindowEvent</font>() = 0
</font></pre>

possible, what isn&amp;apos;t rather usual however. <br>
<br>
The described method While : WindowEvent() : Wend is frequently useful in connection with 
the command <a href="../system/delay.html">Delay()</a>, where the loop is inserted BEFORE the Delay(), e.g. to firstly wait 
for the update of an ImageGadget after changing an image with SetGadgetState().
