<p><b>Introduction</b></p><blockquote>



PureBasic is a modern programming language which evolves quickly to follow technologic changes 
and brings up-to-date commandset to the programmer. It sometimes involves to change or redesign 
some part of the language. While we try to keep these breaking changes to a minimum, it can happen 
and this migration guide will help to update your source from one version to another. 
<br>
<br>
If you need stability instead of cutting edge features, we highly recommend to stick to &amp;apos;LTS&amp;apos; 
(Long Term Support) version of PureBasic, which are released every 2 years, and are actively 
maintained for bug fixes.
