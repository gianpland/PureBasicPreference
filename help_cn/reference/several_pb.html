<p><b>概要</b></p><blockquote>





It is possible to install several PureBasic versions on your hard disk at the same time. 
This is useful to finish one project with an older PureBasic version, and 
start developing a new project with a new PureBasic version. 

 

</blockquote>
<p><b>How to do it</b></p><blockquote>





Create different folders like "PureBasic_v3.94" and "PureBasic_v4" and install the related 
PureBasic version in each folders. 
<br>
<br>
When one "PureBasic.exe" is started, it will assign all ".pb" files 
with this version of PureBasic. So when a source code is loaded by double-clicking 
on the related file, the currently assigned PureBasic version will be started. 
Beside PureBasic will change nothing, which can affect other PureBasic versions in different 
folders. 
<br>
<br>
To avoid the automatic assignment of ".pb" files when starting the IDE, a 
shortcut can be created from PureBasic.exe with "/NOEXT" as parameter. The command line 
options for the IDE are described <a href="../reference/ide_commandline.html">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> Since PureBasic 4.10, the settings for the IDE are no longer saved in the PureBasic 
directory but rather in the %APPDATA%\PureBasic directory. To keep the multiple versions from using 
the same configuration files, the /P /T and /A <a href="../reference/ide_commandline.html">switches</a> can be used. Furthermore there is the /PORTABLE 
switch which puts all files back into the PureBasic directory and disabled the creation of the .pb extension.
